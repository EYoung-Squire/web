        Plot: In Ugly Betty, a Mexican-American woman called Betty Suarez lives with her sister (Hilda), nephew (Justin), and father (Ignacio) in Queens. Despite coming from a humble background, Betty has big dreams, and decides to apply for the role of assistant to the new editor-in-chief of "Mode Magazine", Daniel Meade. However, the people who work at Mode aren't exactly friendly, and she immediately struggles to be accepted in this glamorous but hostile environment. Will Betty be able to overcome the challenges that come with this job, and will she be able to make some strong friendships along the way? In this TV Show, a lot of character development can be seen for all the characters, including one learning how to finally<br>bond with a family member, and one realizing there is more to life then just money. As you<br>progress through the episodes, it is easy to "build connections" with the characters, as you start to<br>understand them more.
